roject: Stochastic Symbolic System (SSS)
A proof-of-concept framework in Python for simulating logical and creative reasoning. This system uses the SymPy library to perform symbolic manipulation of algebraic formulas, creating a dynamic knowledge base that can grow autonomously. It is designed to be a "glass box" AI, where every step of its reasoning process is transparent and observable.
Core Features:
Symbolic Knowledge Base: The system's memory is a list of SymPy equations. It reasons with abstract variables, not numerical data.
Axiomatic Reasoning: The system is built upon a core set of "Axioms"â€”foundational, unquestionable truths that are the ultimate basis for all verification.
Cognitive Skillset: The system possesses a toolbox of fundamental logical operations it can apply to its knowledge:
solve_for(): Isolates a variable in any known formula.
simplify_truth(): Refines formulas into their most elegant and simple form.
verify_hypothesis(): A powerful "Guardian of Logic" that checks if a new statement is consistent with its existing axioms and derived truths.
Autonomous Discovery: The think_for_itself() method allows the system to autonomously explore its knowledge base by randomly applying its cognitive skills, simulating a form of curiosity.
Stochastic Insight Engine: On a configurable chance, the system will generate a random, simple "dummy hypothesis." It explores the consequences of this temporary belief, which can lead to the discovery of non-obvious truths that would be missed by linear logic.
Potential Applications:
Research in AI safety and explainable AI (XAI).
Educational tools for teaching logic and formal systems.
Procedural generation engines for game development.
A framework for building "smart" agents with emergent behavior
